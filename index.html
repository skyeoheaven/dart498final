    <h1>Accessible Painting Box for Low-Vision Painters</h1>
    <h2>a project by Skye O'Hearn-Smith and Claudine Desforges</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>This project explores inclusive design through an innovative portable painting station tailored specifically for low-vision artists. Developed in collaboration with Claudine DesForges, an accomplished visually impaired painter, this design emphasizes independence, creativity, and intuitive usability. Integrating tactile and braille identifiers with modular, removable compartments, it addresses accessibility challenges commonly overlooked in traditional art supplies. Inspired by tactile communication and color identification systems, this painting station transforms painting into a sensory-rich, manageable experience for artists with visual impairments. Through iterative prototyping, 3D printing, and direct user feedback, the final design emerged as a thoughtful reflection on empathetic and inclusive design principles. Although encountering challenges in materials and fabrication, the journey underscored the profound impact of accessible design in empowering creative expression. Ultimately, this project demonstrates how thoughtfully integrated accessibility can reshape art-making experiences, opening creative possibilities to artists of all visual abilities.</p>
